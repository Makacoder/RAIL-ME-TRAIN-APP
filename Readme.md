# Introduction

This project is a Grazaz Academy accelerator challenge 2 assigned to student Backend developer. As a junior backend developer, I am tasked with building endpoints for a train transport company app where prospective commuters are able to sign up, sign in, make successful bookings, edit booking time, delete bookings and can see all services provided by the train transport company.

I'm also expected to resolve in the platform where Admin will be able to see all users, upload new reservation for users to book, and lastly know the total number of bookings done by users on the platform.


## Building and creating endpoints for booking app

In this pattern, we show how to create endpoints to differenciate between Users and Admin, and then profiling Admin rights for authentication and authorization using jason web token.
